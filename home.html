        <h3>Aimee's Hometown</h3>
        <p>
            I was born in Detroit, MI and raised in a suburb called Brownstown. It was an odd arrangment, our township had a Wyandotte city zip code, 
            I attended Woodhaven public schools, and we basically lived in Riverview (based on the boarder lines). In 2013 I moved to Detroit and have
            been there ever since(though I have lived in a few differnt parts of the city). Currently, I live in a histroic neighborhood called the 
            University District which is full of old character and charm.

        <h3>Aimee's Education</h3>
        <p>
            Growing up, I attended Woodhaven Public Schools, but in high school I switched to Gabriel Richard Catholic School. The school pushed me 
            harder academically and was extremely competitive in sports. While attending I played volleyball, tennis, and softball while taking honors 
            and AP courses.
            When graduation came, I chose to attend Central Michigan University for it's size, distance from home, and graphic design program. Graphic 
            design did not work out, I ended up majoring in Entrepreneurship, but CMU was the right place for me to thrive academically and socially.
            When I wasn't studing small business, I was an active member of Sigma Kappa Sorority. I still have those friendships almost 20 years later.
            As a new grad in 2008, the job market was T-O-U-G-H. I love learning and felt I could use more education while waiting for the job market to 
            open up, so I attended Eastern Michigan University and received a Master's of Science in Apparel, Merchandising, and Textiles. Through this 
            degree, I was also able to travel to Los Angeles, Paris, and London to learn about different fashion markets. That was the highlight of my 
            Master's program!
